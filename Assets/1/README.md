\*\* Task 1 \*\* 

'Boost' is set to 'space' and 'shift'
Modified anchor positions and axis values on all Carriages such that the piviot point was consistent for each point. (original pivots varied on the x axis making the torque unstable)
Increaed Angular dampening and modified Mass Scale :: Connected Mass Scale on carriages. 

Decisions around Rigidbody & constraints were made mostly on Game Feel- these modification felt best (personally) when playtesting.

Otherwise no noteworthy implementation details other than code in SpinningWheel.cs and Physics Simulation update changes.
