# TechnicalTestSupport2025

\*\* Task 2 \*\* 



Created a plugin that targets Android devices using Android studio. The plugin is made of two parts- a '.jar' and '.so' file. The plugin project can be found within this zip TechnicalTestSupport2025->ExternalPlugin->timeDataLocale. The Plugin uses both java and C++. 



The Project was switched to the android platform and deployed to a personal One Plus Android device during development. The deployed app with device info results can be seen in 'deployment\_results.jpg'.
